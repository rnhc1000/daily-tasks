Simply jot down a quick note about a task, add it to a list, and you're done. It's implemented using Angular 17+ as the frontend framework to practice new skills. The idea is to have an easy and quick reminder of completed and pending tasks at the end of the day, without the usual burden of other apps. So, tired of a thousand clicks and a complex UI decided to create an uncomplicated online tool for quickly noting my tasks, eliminating the need for Post-it notes all over the place. The roadmap for new features will be as follows:\nIf you need any further adjustments, feel free to let me know. 😊\nThe roadmap of new features will be as follows:\nRoadmap of Future App Features\n\nURL: https://todo-list.ferreiras.dev.br\nTimestamp of each task indicating start and end time.\nAutentication based on Argon2 and Pepper with notification being sent to a registered email\nUsage of localStorage or Firebase to allow history pagination of tasks completed or !completed\nCalendar + agenda to allow schedule tasks days ahead\nNotification of tasks to be done along the day.\n\nTable of contents\n\ntask-list -
